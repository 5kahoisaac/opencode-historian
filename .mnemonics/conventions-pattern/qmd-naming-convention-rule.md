Rule: The naming of qmd's index and collection must ALWAYS be in kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens separating words).

Good examples:
- my-collection
- user-sessions  
- conversation-history

Bad examples:
- myCollection
- MyCollection
- user_sessions
- userSessions

This is a strict convention that must be followed when creating or referencing qmd indexes and collections.
